# Angular TypeScript Playground

A playground for playing with `Angular` and `TypeScript`. This project creates `Generic Service` that acts as Store for any type of data. 
Different components set and get data from the store. The store data type can be `Employee`, `Book`, `Product`, etc.

See [Generic Service](src/app/store/generic-store.service.ts) for store details
